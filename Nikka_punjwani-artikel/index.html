            <p>Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of
                its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide,
                with more than 1,000 varieties.

                Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its large
                edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a
                pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless
                varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. It may
                also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.

                Kordofan melons from Sudan are the closest relatives and may be progenitors of modern, cultivated
                watermelons.[2] Wild watermelon seeds were found in Uan Muhuggiag, a prehistoric site in Libya that
                dates to approximately 3500 BC.[3] Watermelons were domesticated in north-east Africa, and cultivated in
                Egypt by 2000 BC, although they were not the sweet modern variety. Sweet dessert watermelons spread
                across the Mediterranean world during Roman times.[4]

                Considerable breeding effort has developed disease-resistant varieties. Many cultivars are available
                that produce mature fruit within 100 days of planting. In 2017, China produced about two-thirds of the
                world's total of watermelons.</p>

                The watermelon is an annual that has a prostrate or climbing habit. Stems are up to 3 metres (10 feet)
                long and new growth has yellow or brown hairs. Leaves are 60 to 200 millimetres (2+1⁄4 to 7+3⁄4 inches)
                long and 40 to 150 mm (1+1⁄2 to 6 in) wide. These usually have three lobes that are lobed or doubly
                lobed. Young growth is densely woolly with yellowish-brown hairs which disappear as the plant ages. Like
                all but one species in the genus Citrullus, watermelon has branching tendrils. Plants have unisexual
                male or female flowers that are white or yellow and borne on 40-millimetre-long (1+1⁄2 in) hairy stalks.
                Each flower grows singly in the leaf axils, and the species' sexual system, with male and female flowers
                produced on each plant, is (monoecious). The male flowers predominate at the beginning of the season;
                the female flowers, which develop later, have inferior ovaries. The styles are united into a single
                column.[citation needed]

                The large fruit is a kind of modified berry called a pepo with a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center
                (mesocarp and endocarp).[5] Wild plants have fruits up to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter, while cultivated
                varieties may exceed 60 cm (24 in). The rind of the fruit is mid- to dark green and usually mottled or
                striped, and the flesh, containing numerous pips spread throughout the inside, can be red or pink (most
                commonly), orange, yellow, green or white.[6][7]

                A bitter watermelon, C. amarus, has become naturalized in semiarid regions of several continents, and is
                designated as a "pest plant" in parts of Western Australia where they are called "pig melon".[8]
